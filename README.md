**This project is created to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in Automation Testing.**

**About:**

The project contains a generic but smart automation infrastructure. It is build in heirarchy order with modules. Each model contains classes with methods. There main/commonOps/extensions/pageObjects/utilities/workflow modules, so tests can be created quickly and simply with minimum line codes. The infrastructure allows us to work with several kinds of applications such as: Web, Mobile, API, Desktop & Electron. The biggest advantage of this infrastructure that it can me easily maintained and custom to any other application.
